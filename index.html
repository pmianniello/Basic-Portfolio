            <p id="bio"><img src ="assets/images/biopic.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">Originally from Saratoga Springs, NY, I have been located in Richmond, Virginia for the past 15 years. I became interested in web development somewhat circuitously after becoming a PC hobbyist, and learning that when you learn how to code, the amount of things you can do with a computer becomes incredibly limitless. When I am not working or doing schoolwork I enjoy playing music and going to live shows, my cat Prince, dining out and being bad at PC games.</p>
